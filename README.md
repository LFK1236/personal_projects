# personal_projects
Personal exercises/projects that are at least somewhat presentable.

It's all a learning experience, so if you have any suggestions for anything I've released publically here, please let me know. Or if you're looking for a part-time programmer around Copenhagen/Frederiksberg :)

Thanks, Louis.
